# Cellphone-Price-Range-Prediction
Machine Learning Project
## Problem Statement:
1) Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
2) On the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled ,
wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc predict the Price range of the mobile.
3) Prepare the analysis report stating how model will help expanding the
business by stating several factors including feature importance.
## Steps involved:
### 1) Importing Neccessary libraries and dataset:
i) Numpy 

ii) Pandas 

iii) seaborn 

iv) matplotlib.pyplot 

### 2) Basic Checks and Data Cleaning:
i) Checking for the top and bottom entries to get overall look on the data. 

ii) Checking for duplicates 

iii) Checking the data types 

iv) Checking for the null values 

### 3) EDA:
i) Finding the discriptive statistics for the given dataset 

ii) Univariate Analysis through graphical representation 

iii) Bivariate Analysis through graphical representation 

### 4) Checking for the dependency and multicollinearity using heatmap
### 5) Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
i) Outlier Handling 

ii) Standerdization 

### 6) Model Implementation:
i) Logistic Regression 

ii) Decision Tree 

iii) Random Forest 

iv) KNN 

v) SVM 

vi) XGBoost 

### 7) Saving the best model
## Key Findings:
### 1) Best Model:
The best model among the all models is Logistic Regression with 95.83% of accuracy and high F1 score (94% - 98%) indicating that the balanced performence of model.
### 2) How Model will help to expand the business:
i) Product Development: Focus on Key Features, Improve RAM, battery life, and display quality (pixel height and width) since customers care about these the most.

ii) Marketing Strategies: Create ads that highlight the strengths in RAM, battery life, and display quality to attract more customers.

iii) Pricing Strategies: Set prices based on how much customers value RAM, battery life, and display quality.Use real-time data to adjust prices and maximize sales and profits.

iv) Customer Satisfaction: Provide products that match what customers want, increasing their satisfaction and loyalty.

v) Market Expansion: Identify new areas where high RAM, battery life, and display quality are important, and target these markets.
